JUMP THE QUEUE
When visiting public (free) or private (paid) events there are often large queues creating significant waiting 
times. Ideally the organizer of the event would like to streamline the entry of people into the venue.
If people were to arrive right on time they could get into line more efficiently. A website or application 
could support this process by assigning visitors a queue number. This document describes the design of such a
 website/application, appropriately named JumpTheQueue.

Technical Architecture:
We have designed our application in 3 layered architecture. these are divided as follows:-
For front end we have used devon4ng in angular and for backend we have used devon4j in java.

 
Execution: For the execution of front end 'devon ng serve' command has been used. For backend execution we have run the application in Eclipse..
           For checking the backend functionalities we have used Postman. 
           For checking the frontend functionalities we have used chrome.
           
Integration: We have integrated backend and frontend using the REST API calls.
