JUMP THE QUEUE
When visiting public (free) or private (paid) events there are often large queues creating significant waiting times. Ideally the organizer of the event would like to streamline the entry of people into the venue. If people were to arrive right on time they could get into line more efficiently. A website or application could support this process by assigning visitors a queue number. This document describes the design of such a website/application, appropriately named JumpTheQueue.
